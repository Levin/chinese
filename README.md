# Chinese Learning Journey

## Current Progress (March 2025)

I've been documenting my Chinese language learning since early March 2025. My current proficiency includes:

- **Basic Grammar Structures**: Using 我能/我可以 (I can), 我会 (I will/can), 我应该 (I should)
- **Question Words**: Mastered 怎么 (what/how), 为怎么 (why), 谁 (who), 哪里 (where), 怎么时候 (when)
- **Demonstratives**: Using 这 (this) and 那 (that) with objects and locations
- **Past Tense**: Expressing completed actions with 了 particle
- **Conditional Sentences**: Using 如果 (if) to construct basic conditionals
- **Location Expressions**: Discussing places like 长城 (Great Wall), 故宫 (Forbidden City)
- **Companion Phrases**: Using 跟 (with) to describe accompanying others
- **Descriptive Adjectives**: Using 老 (old), 大 (big), 胖 (fat) with change marker 了
- **Food and Drink**: Basic vocabulary for ordering and discussing meals

My notes capture vocabulary, sentence patterns, and grammar points from regular lessons, with progressive complexity from early March through mid-March 2025.

## HSK Level Assessment

Based on my current vocabulary and grammar knowledge, my Chinese proficiency corresponds to approximately:

- **HSK Level 1-2**: I have mastered most of the vocabulary and grammar points required for HSK 1 (150 words) and am working through HSK 2 (300 words) content
- **Strengths**: Basic question formations, simple past tense expressions, location phrases, and demonstratives
- **Areas for Growth**: Expanding vocabulary, mastering measure words, and developing more complex sentence structures
- **Conversation Ability**: Can handle simple exchanges about personal information, time, food, and basic needs

I can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. I can introduce myself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where I live, people I know, and things I have.
