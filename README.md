# Chinese Learning Journey

## Current Progress (March 2025)

I've been documenting my Chinese language learning since early March 2025. My current proficiency includes:

- **Basic Grammar Structures**: Using 我能/我可以 (I can), 我会 (I will/can), 我应该 (I should), 我要 (I want to/will)
- **Question Words**: Mastered 怎么 (what/how), 为怎么 (why), 谁 (who), 哪里 (where), 怎么时候 (when)
- **Demonstratives**: Using 这 (this) and 那 (that) with objects and locations
- **Past Tense**: Expressing completed actions with 了 particle
- **Conditional Sentences**: Using 如果 (if) to construct basic conditionals
- **Location Expressions**: Discussing places like 长城 (Great Wall), 故宫 (Forbidden City)
- **Companion Phrases**: Using 跟 (with) to describe accompanying others
- **Descriptive Adjectives**: Using 老 (old), 大 (big), 胖 (fat) with change marker 了
- **Food and Drink**: Basic vocabulary for ordering and discussing meals
- **Time Expressions**: Using 过一会儿 (in a while/later) to discuss future actions
- **Future Planning**: Forming sentences with 可不可以 (can we?) and expressing intentions with 我要 (I'm going to)

My notes capture vocabulary, sentence patterns, and grammar points from regular lessons, with progressive complexity from early March through mid-March 2025.

## HSK Level Assessment

Based on my current vocabulary and grammar knowledge, my Chinese proficiency corresponds to approximately:

- **HSK Level 1-2**: I have mastered most of the vocabulary and grammar points required for HSK 1 (150 words) and am working through HSK 2 (300 words) content
- **Strengths**: Basic question formations, simple past tense expressions, location phrases, and demonstratives
- **Areas for Growth**: Expanding vocabulary, mastering measure words, and developing more complex sentence structures
- **Conversation Ability**: Can handle simple exchanges about personal information, time, food, and basic needs

I can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. I can introduce myself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where I live, people I know, and things I have.
