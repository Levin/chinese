# Chinese Learning Journey

## Current Progress (Early April 2025)

This log documents my Chinese language learning journey.

Key areas covered recently include:

- **Grammar Structures**:
    - Emphasizing details of past actions with `是...的` (shì...de)
    - Comparisons using `比` (bǐ)
    - Contrasting ideas with `虽然...但是/还是...` (suīrán...dànshì/háishì)
    - Expressing cause and effect with `因为...所以...` (yīnwèi...suǒyǐ...)
    - Indicating completion with resultative complements (e.g., `V + 完` wán)
    - Expressing capability/inability with potential complements (e.g., `看得懂` kàn de dǒng, `听不清楚` tīng bu qīngchu)
    - Expressing "too..." with `太...了` (tài...le)
    - Using `和...一起` (hé...yìqǐ) for actions done together
    - Expressing alternatives in statements with `或者` (huòzhě)
    - Correct past negation using `没有` (méiyǒu)
- **Question Words**: Refined use of `为什么` (wèishéme), `什么时候` (shénme shíhou), `怎么` (zěnme) including `怎么去` (zěnme qù)
- **Vocabulary Expansion**:
    - Time: `每天` (měitiān), `周末` (zhōumò), `去年` (qùnián)
    - People & Relations: `朋友` (péngyou), `哥哥` (gēge)
    - Objects: `电脑` (diànnǎo), `手机` (shǒujī), `书` (shū), `电子邮件` (diànzǐ yóujiàn), `衣服` (yīfu), `衬衫` (chènshān), `茶` (chá), `火车` (huǒchē), `地铁` (dìtiě)
    - Actions: `学习` (xuéxí), `买` (mǎi), `写` (xiě), `懂` (dǒng), `练习` (liànxí), `游泳` (yóuyǒng), `坐` (zuò - transport)
    - Descriptions: `新` (xīn), `长` (cháng), `高` (gāo), `冷` (lěng), `清楚` (qīngchu), `贵` (guì), `坏` (huài - broken), `有意思` (yǒu yìsi)
    - Places: `上海` (Shànghǎi)
    - Other: `已经` (yǐjīng), `请` (qǐng), `给` (gěi), `对不起` (duìbuqǐ)
- **Measure Words**: Practiced `本` (běn - for books), `杯` (bēi - for cups), `件` (jiàn - for clothes), using `两` (liǎng) instead of `二` (èr) before measure words.

My study involves regular practice translating sentences, focusing on applying learned grammar and vocabulary, with feedback provided on accuracy and naturalness.

## HSK Level Assessment

Based on current vocabulary and grammar knowledge, proficiency is estimated around:

- **HSK Level 2 (Solid) / HSK Level 3 (Emerging)**: Comfortable with most HSK 2 requirements (300 words, core grammar). Starting to incorporate HSK 3 structures like potential complements, `比` comparisons, and resultative complements.
- **Strengths**: Basic sentence structures, question formation, past negation, time expressions, common vocabulary.
- **Areas for Growth**: Consistent application of more complex grammar (e.g., `比`, complements), expanding vocabulary, improving naturalness and fluency.
- **Conversation Ability**: Can handle simple conversations on familiar topics, express preferences, make comparisons, and describe past events with increasing detail.

I can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g., very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment). I can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. I can describe in simple terms aspects of my background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.

## Previous Progress (March 2025)

My proficiency documented around mid-March included:

- **Basic Grammar Structures**: Using 我能/我可以 (I can), 我会 (I will/can), 我应该 (I should), 我要 (I want to/will)
- **Question Words**: Mastered 怎么 (what/how), 为怎么 (why - noting standard is 为什么), 谁 (who), 哪里 (where), 怎么时候 (when)
- **Demonstratives**: Using 这 (this) and 那 (that) with objects and locations
- **Past Tense**: Expressing completed actions with 了 particle
- **Conditional Sentences**: Using 如果 (if) to construct basic conditionals
- **Location Expressions**: Discussing places like 长城 (Great Wall), 故宫 (Forbidden City)
- **Companion Phrases**: Using 跟 (with) to describe accompanying others
- **Descriptive Adjectives**: Using 老 (old), 大 (big), 胖 (fat) with change marker 了
- **Food and Drink**: Basic vocabulary for ordering and discussing meals
- **Time Expressions**: Using 过一会儿 (in a while/later) to discuss future actions
- **Future Planning**: Forming sentences with 可不可以 (can we?) and expressing intentions with 我要 (I'm going to)

My notes from that period capture vocabulary, sentence patterns, and grammar points from regular lessons, with progressive complexity from early March through mid-March 2025.
