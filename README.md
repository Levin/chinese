# Chinese Learning Journey

## Latest Focus (April 10, 2025)

- **Targeted Practice**: Conducted focused exercises specifically on:
    - **Relative Clauses**: Reinforcing the `Modifier + 的 + Noun` structure (e.g., `我昨天借的书`, `刚才给你打电话的人`).
    - **是...的 Structure**: Practicing its use for emphasizing time, place, manner, and agent in both statements and questions (e.g., `是什么时候来的？`, `是坐火车来的`, `是谁告诉你的？`).
- **Observations**: Continued practice needed to solidify the application of these two key structures, particularly ensuring correct word order and usage in different contexts (questions vs. statements).

## Current Progress (Mid-April 2025)

This log documents my Chinese language learning journey.

Key areas covered recently include:

- **Grammar Structures**:
    - Emphasizing details of past actions with `是...的` (shì...de) (time, place, manner, agent)
    - Forming questions with `是...的`
    - Constructing **Relative Clauses** (Modifier + `的` + Noun) (e.g., `我买的书` - the book I bought)
    - Comparisons using `比` (bǐ)
    - Contrasting ideas with `虽然...但是/还是...` (suīrán...dànshì/háishì)
    - Expressing cause and effect with `因为...所以...` (yīnwèi...suǒyǐ...)
    - Indicating completion with resultative complements (e.g., `V + 完` wán, `V + 好` hǎo)
    - Expressing capability/inability with potential complements (e.g., `看得懂`, `听不清楚`)
    - Expressing "too..." with `太...了` (tài...le)
    - Using `和...一起` (hé...yìqǐ) for actions done together
    - Expressing alternatives in statements (`或者` huòzhě) and questions (`还是` háishi)
    - Correct past negation using `没有` (méiyǒu)
    - Expressing "a bit" + adjective (`有点儿 + Adj`, `Adj + 一点儿`)
- **Question Words & Formation**: Refined use of `为什么`, `什么时候`, `怎么`, `哪里`; correct use of `吗` particle.
- **Vocabulary Expansion**:
    - Time: `每天`, `周末`, `去年`, `刚才` (gāngcái), `小时` (xiǎoshí), `点` (diǎn), `早上/晚上` (zǎoshang/wǎnshang)
    - People & Relations: `朋友`, `哥哥`, `妹妹` (mèimei), `妈妈` (māma), `人` (rén)
    - Objects: `电脑`, `手机`, `书`, `电子邮件`, `衣服`, `衬衫`, `茶`, `咖啡`, `牛奶` (niúnǎi), `蛋糕` (dàngāo), `照片` (zhàopiàn), `礼物` (lǐwù), `作业` (zuòyè)
    - Actions: `学习`, `买`, `写`, `懂`, `练习`, `游泳`, `跑步` (pǎobù), `锻炼` (duànliàn), `坐`, `拍` (pāi), `借/还` (jiè/huán), `告诉` (gàosu), `帮助` (bāngzhù), `迟到` (chídào), `逛街` (guàngjiē), `弹钢琴` (tán gāngqín), `打电话` (dǎ diànhuà), `发短信` (fā duǎnxìn), `准备` (zhǔnbèi)
    - Descriptions: `新`, `长`, `高`, `冷`, `清楚`, `贵`, `坏`, `有意思`, `快` (kuài), `难` (nán), `不错` (búcuò), `忙` (máng), `慢` (màn), `大声` (dàshēng), `安静` (ānjìng)
    - Places: `上海`, `北京` (Běijīng), `家` (jiā), `公园` (gōngyuán), `图书馆` (túshūguǎn), `城市` (chéngshì)
    - Events: `考试` (kǎoshì), `聚会` (jùhuì), `会议` (huìyì)
    - Other: `已经`, `请`, `给`, `对不起`, `应该` (yīnggāi)
- **Measure Words**: Continued practice (`本`, `杯`, `件`, `瓶` píng, `个` gè, `家` jiā), using `两`.

My study involves regular practice translating sentences, focusing on applying learned grammar and vocabulary. **Recent sessions have included targeted exercises specifically on Relative Clauses and the `是...的` structure to improve accuracy and fluency with these patterns.**

## HSK Level Assessment

Based on current vocabulary and grammar knowledge, proficiency is estimated around:

- **HSK Level 2 (Solid) / HSK Level 3 (Developing)**: Comfortable with HSK 2 requirements. Actively working on HSK 3 structures like complements, comparisons, and basic relative clauses.
- **Strengths**: Basic sentence structures, comparisons with `比`, choice questions with `还是`, past negation, time expressions, core vocabulary.
- **Areas for Growth**: **Consistent and accurate application of Relative Clauses and the `是...的` structure.** Expanding vocabulary, improving sentence fluency and naturalness.
- **Conversation Ability**: Can handle simple conversations on familiar topics, make comparisons, describe past events, and increasingly understand and use more complex sentence patterns.

I can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g., very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment). I can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. I can describe in simple terms aspects of my background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.

## Previous Progress (March 2025)

My proficiency documented around mid-March included:

- **Basic Grammar Structures**: Using 我能/我可以 (I can), 我会 (I will/can), 我应该 (I should), 我要 (I want to/will)
- **Question Words**: Mastered 怎么 (what/how), 为怎么 (why - noting standard is 为什么), 谁 (who), 哪里 (where), 怎么时候 (when)
- **Demonstratives**: Using 这 (this) and 那 (that) with objects and locations
- **Past Tense**: Expressing completed actions with 了 particle
- **Conditional Sentences**: Using 如果 (if) to construct basic conditionals
- **Location Expressions**: Discussing places like 长城 (Great Wall), 故宫 (Forbidden City)
- **Companion Phrases**: Using 跟 (with) to describe accompanying others
- **Descriptive Adjectives**: Using 老 (old), 大 (big), 胖 (fat) with change marker 了
- **Food and Drink**: Basic vocabulary for ordering and discussing meals
- **Time Expressions**: Using 过一会儿 (in a while/later) to discuss future actions
- **Future Planning**: Forming sentences with 可不可以 (can we?) and expressing intentions with 我要 (I'm going to)

My notes from that period capture vocabulary, sentence patterns, and grammar points from regular lessons, with progressive complexity from early March through mid-March 2025.
