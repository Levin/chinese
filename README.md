# Chinese Learning Journey

## Current Progress (Early April 2025)

This log documents my Chinese language learning journey.

Key areas covered recently include:

- **Grammar Structures**:
    - Emphasizing details of past actions with `是...的` (shì...de)
    - Comparisons using `比` (bǐ)
    - Contrasting ideas with `虽然...但是/还是...` (suīrán...dànshì/háishì)
    - Expressing cause and effect with `因为...所以...` (yīnwèi...suǒyǐ...)
    - Indicating completion with resultative complements (e.g., `V + 完` wán)
    - Expressing capability/inability with potential complements (e.g., `看得懂` kàn de dǒng, `听不清楚` tīng bu qīngchu)
    - Expressing "too..." with `太...了` (tài...le)
    - Using `和...一起` (hé...yìqǐ) for actions done together
    - Expressing alternatives in statements with `或者` (huòzhě)
    - Correct past negation using `没有` (méiyǒu)
- **Question Words**: Refined use of `为什么` (wèishéme), `什么时候` (shénme shíhou), `怎么` (zěnme) including `怎么去` (zěnme qù)
- **Vocabulary Expansion**:
    - Time: `每天` (měitiān), `周末` (zhōumò), `去年` (qùnián)
    - People & Relations: `朋友` (péngyou), `哥哥` (gēge)
    - Objects: `电脑` (diànnǎo), `手机` (shǒujī), `书` (shū), `电子邮件` (diànzǐ yóujiàn), `衣服` (yīfu), `衬衫` (chènshān), `茶` (chá), `火车` (huǒchē), `地铁` (dìtiě)
    - Actions: `学习` (xuéxí), `买` (mǎi), `写` (xiě), `懂` (dǒng), `练习` (liànxí), `游泳` (yóuyǒng), `坐` (zuò - transport)
    - Descriptions: `新` (xīn), `长` (cháng), `高` (gāo), `冷` (lěng), `清楚` (qīngchu), `贵` (guì), `坏` (huài - broken), `有意思` (yǒu yìsi)
    - Places: `上海` (Shànghǎi)
    - Other: `已经` (yǐjīng), `请` (qǐng), `给` (gěi), `对不起` (duìbuqǐ)
- **Measure Words**: Practiced `本` (běn - for books), `杯` (bēi - for cups), `件` (jiàn - for clothes), using `两` (liǎng) instead of `二` (èr) before measure words.

My study involves regular practice translating sentences, focusing on applying learned grammar and vocabulary, with feedback provided on accuracy and naturalness.

## HSK Level Assessment

Based on current vocabulary and grammar knowledge, proficiency is estimated around:

- **HSK Level 2 (Solid) / HSK Level 3 (Emerging)**: Comfortable with most HSK 2 requirements (300 words, core grammar). Starting to incorporate HSK 3 structures like potential complements, `比` comparisons, and resultative complements.
- **Strengths**: Basic sentence structures, question formation, past negation, time expressions, common vocabulary.
- **Areas for Growth**: Consistent application of more complex grammar (e.g., `比`, complements), expanding vocabulary, improving naturalness and fluency.
- **Conversation Ability**: Can handle simple conversations on familiar topics, express preferences, make comparisons, and describe past events with increasing detail.

I can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g., very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment). I can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. I can describe in simple terms aspects of my background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.
