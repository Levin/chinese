**English Text:**

Yesterday, I forgot to bring my book to class. The teacher who often helps me lent me her book. I couldn't hear what she was saying at first because the classroom was noisy.
After class, I found my keys and went back home. I plan to study more this weekend. By the way, can you bring over the notes tomorrow?

**Your Translation:**

昨天， 我我的书课。
老师给我她的书。 
我听不懂她说应为是的。
会来课， 我我的也回家。
我会学了这个周末。
。。。你明天会？


**Correction:**

昨天，我忘记带我的书去上课。
经常帮助我的老师借给我她的书。
开始我听不清她说什么因为教室很吵。
下课后，我找到了我的钥匙然后回家了。
我打算这个周末多学习。
顺便说一下，你明天能带笔记过来吗？

**Notes:**

1. Missing key verbs: 忘记(forget), 带(bring), 上(attend) in first sentence
2. Used incorrect structure for relative clause: should be "经常帮助我的老师" (the teacher who often helps me)
3. Used 给 instead of 借给 for "lent"
4. Incorrect characters: 应为 should be 因为 (because)
5. Missing directional complement 过来 in the last sentence
6. Need to use 打算 for "plan to" rather than 会

**Chinese Text:**

我经常在这家咖啡店学习中文。
昨天我在这里看到的那个人是我的中文老师。
这个地方很安静，所以我能听见别人说话。
我打算下个月去上海，因为我朋友在那里工作。
学习汉语有时候很难，但是我能解决这些问题。

**Your Translation:**

**Correction:**

I often study Chinese at this coffee shop.
The person I saw here yesterday was my Chinese teacher.
This place is very quiet, so I can hear other people talking.
I plan to go to Shanghai next month, because my friend works there.
Learning Chinese is sometimes difficult, but I can solve these problems.
By the way, can you help me find that red book?

**Notes:**

1. "经常" means "often/frequently" not "give"
2. "看到的那个人" uses the 的 structure to mean "the person (whom) I saw"
3. "安静" means "quiet" not "clean" (混淆了"干净"和"安静")
4. "下个月" means "next month" not "this month"
5. "汉语" refers to "Chinese language" not "English"
6. "顺便说一下" is an expression meaning "by the way" not literally "say one"
7. Missing color descriptor: "红色的" means "red"
