小猫在公园。:> the little cat is in the park. ✅ Correct.
它没有家，也没有人。:> it does not have a home and also no person to go to. ❗ A bit off. "It has no home and no one (with it)." → 没有人 here means "no one to care for it" or "no companion."
它一个人走来走去，看一看，听一听 :> its person *i dont know: walk come walk go*, sees one, tears one. ❗ Needs clarification. "It walks around alone, looks, and listens." → "走来走去" means pacing or walking back and forth. "一个人" = alone.
