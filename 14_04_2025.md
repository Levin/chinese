# 小猫找家 (The Little Cat Looks for a Home)

小猫在公园。:> the little cat is in the park. ✅ Correct.
它没有家，也没有人。:> it does not have a home and also no person to go to. ❗ A bit off. "It has no home and no one (with it)." → 没有人 here means "no one to care for it" or "no companion."
它一个人走来走去，看一看，听一听 :> its person *i dont know: walk come walk go*, sees one, tears one. ❗ Needs clarification. "It walks around alone, looks, and listens." → "走来走去" means pacing or walking back and forth. "一个人" = alone.
它看到一个男孩，男孩也看到它。 :> it finds a boy and the boy also sees it. ✅ Good understanding! Slightly better: "It sees a boy, and the boy sees it too."
男孩走过来，说：“你好，小猫！” :> the boy is asking/saying: hello, little cat. ✅ Correct. Small improvement: "The boy walks over and says, 'Hello, little cat!'"
小猫看着他，轻轻地说：“喵喵。” :> the small cat watches and then also says: "miao miao". ✅ Almost perfect! "Looks at him" instead of "watches." And "gently says" for "轻轻地说."
男孩笑了，拿出一点牛奶。:> the boy *i dont know (finished/le)*, taking out some milk. ✅ "笑了" means "smiled" (了 marks a completed action). "He smiled and took out some milk."
小猫喝了牛奶，高高兴兴地摇尾巴。:> the small cat drinks milk, happy and *i dont know*. ✅ Great try! "高高兴兴地" = happily, and "摇尾巴" = wagged its tail. "The little cat drank the milk and happily wagged its tail."
男孩说：“你没有家吗？:> the boy says: "dont you have a home?" ✅ Correct!
跟我回家吧。:> come home with me." ✅ Perfect.
小猫点点头，跟着男孩走了。:> The small cat *dian dian ... i dont know*, and walks home following the boy. ✅ Very close. "点点头" = nodded (repeated action = light nodding). "跟着" = followed. → "The little cat nodded and followed the boy."
现在，小猫有家了，也有朋友了。now, the small cat has a home and a friend. ✅ Spot on!

- You're starting to pick up on grammatical particles like "了" — keep noticing how they work with verbs.
- Try learning common patterns like "走来走去" (walk back and forth) and adverbs like "高高兴兴地" (happily — formed by repeating an adjective).
- Excellent effort with context guesses. You're thinking like a language learner should!
